# Engineering Log

Chronological record of every deliberate change to the system, why it was made, and how
it was verified. Feeds Chapter 4 (System Design) and Chapter 6 (Results).

Rules for this file:
- One entry per change. Newest at the bottom.
- Record the *verification* actually run, not the intent to verify.
- If something was found to be broken, record it even if not yet fixed.

## 2026-08-06 — Baseline established

**State of the system before any roadmap work.**

Environment
| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Interpreter | `.venv/bin/python` — Python 3.9.6 (EOL; requires `from __future__ import annotations`) |
| System Python | 3.14.6 |
| Test framework | none installed |
| Source size | 37 files, 8,532 LOC (`.py`, `.js`, `.html`, `.css`, tracked) |
| Git | branch `main`, working tree clean at `e36b1ef` |

LLM tiers (from runtime startup banner — authoritative)
| Tier | Backend |
|---|---|
| primary | Gemini `gemini-2.5-flash` |
| fast | Gemini `gemini-2.0-flash` |
| economy | Ollama `qwen3-coder:30b` @ `http://localhost:11434` |

RAG collections (`data/chroma_db`)
| Collection | Documents |
|---|---|
| sigma_rules | 2382 |
| cwe_kb | 944 |
| mitre_attack | 691 |
| sigma_taxonomy | 332 |
| sysmon_info | 18 |

Local data: `data/sigma` 4099 `.yml` (3104 under `rules/`) · 29 sessions · 7 saved rules.

**Verification run:** `.venv/bin/python -c "import backend.main"` → imports cleanly.
Loads 29 sessions, initialises embeddings, agent, and translator. This is currently the
*only* available regression check.

**Known defects at baseline** (verified by reading code, see `memory/architecture-audit.md`):
1. pySigma is installed and pinned (`requirements.txt:22`) but **not used for validation**.
   `stage_review.py:245-326` hand-rolls ~5 checks with `yaml.safe_load`, while pySigma
   ships 33 validator classes.
2. RAG few-shot exemplars are embedded as **Python dict reprs, not YAML**
   (`vector_store.py:163-168` — `f"Detection: {r['detection']}"` where `detection` is a dict).
3. Rule corpus is **filtered to Windows/Sysmon only** (`ingest_rules.py:38`) → 2382 of 4099
   rules indexed, zero network/proxy/webserver/cloud/linux — while `prompts.py:235`
   mandates initial-access network coverage.
4. Coverage check is **substring matching**, not semantic (`stage_attack_vector.py:171+`),
   yet it drives regeneration (`orchestrator.py:185`).
5. `json_mode=True` is set on the generation call — the most reasoning-heavy stage
   (`stage_generate.py:235`); cf. Tam et al. arXiv 2408.02442.
6. The `fast` tier is **dead code** — no stage requests it; it exists only as the
   Ollama-failure fallback (`llm_client.py:329`).
7. No tests, no eval harness, no token/latency instrumentation.

**Note for the thesis:** defects 2 and 3 are grounding failures invisible to static code
review and to the existing output — the system produces plausible rules regardless. They
are direct evidence for the argument in Chapter 6.4 that systematic evaluation is
necessary, and they become ablation arms A2 and A3.

## 2026-08-06 — Change 0: test harness + characterization tests

**Motivation.** No regression check existed beyond `import backend.main`, which would not
have caught any of the 7 baseline defects. Before modifying validation logic we need to
pin its current behaviour, so that replacing it produces a *visible* behavioural diff
rather than a silent change.

**Constraint that shaped the design.** The economy tier (Ollama on the lab NVIDIA Spark)
is only reachable over VPN. The automated suite must therefore run fully offline: no
network, no LLM calls. `ReviewStage` is constructed with `client=None, vector_store=None`
— neither is touched by the functions under test.

**Changes**
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `requirements-dev.txt` | new — `pytest==8.4.2`, kept out of the pinned `requirements.txt` |
| `tests/test_review_validation.py` | new — 11 characterization tests |

Tests pin `ReviewStage._validate_syntax` across: valid rule (zero issues), malformed YAML,
non-mapping YAML, missing required field, detection without `condition`, detection without
selections, non-standard `level` (warning), vague `logsource` (warning), non-`attack.*` tag
(info), rule-index threading; plus `_validate_mitre_tactics` degrading to `[]` when no
vector store is present.

**Verification**
```
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q
11 passed, 1 warning in 0.10s
```
Ran with VPN disconnected. No LLM startup banner emitted, confirming no client
initialisation and no network access.

**Incidental finding (not a defect).** `grep '^import' backend/pipeline/prompts.py` matches
`import subprocess` at `prompts.py:486`. Inspected: it is inside a triple-quoted prompt
string, part of a few-shot example of malicious code for the PoC-analysis stage. Benign.
Recorded here because the same false positive will recur in any static scan of this repo.

**Documentation defect found.** `base_stage.py:40` documents `fast=True` as
`gemini-2.5-flash-lite` used for "web search only". Both halves are wrong: the runtime
banner reports `fast → gemini-2.0-flash`, and `llm_client.py:174` shows `web_search()`
uses the *primary* model and limiter. The `fast` tier is unreachable from any stage.
Not fixed yet — logged as part of defect 6.

## 2026-08-06 — Change 1: replace hand-rolled validation with pySigma

Addresses baseline defect 1. **Zero API cost** — the validation path is deterministic;
all verification ran offline with VPN disconnected.

### Prior state
`ReviewStage._validate_syntax` performed ~5 checks over a `yaml.safe_load` dict:
required-field presence, a logsource sanity check, a detection/condition check, a
`level` allow-list, and a tag prefix check. pySigma was pinned in `requirements.txt`
but used nowhere in the validation path.

### API investigation (read-only, pySigma 0.11.23)
Registry `sigma.validators.core.validators` contains **31** concrete validator classes.
*(An earlier estimate of 33 counted abstract base classes — corrected.)*

pySigma separates two phases the previous code conflated:
- **parse time** — `SigmaCollection.from_yaml()` raises on spec violations
- **validate time** — `SigmaValidator.validate_rules()` returns advisory issues graded
  `LOW` / `MEDIUM` / `HIGH`

Three traps identified before writing any code:
1. `SigmaValidator` **retains state across `validate_rules()` calls.** Reusing one
   instance made `DuplicateTitleIssue` and `IdentifierCollisionIssue` fire as false
   positives on unrelated rules. A fresh validator is constructed per call.
2. **The exception surface is not unified.** Malformed YAML raises `yaml.ParserError`;
   a non-mapping document leaks a bare `AttributeError` from inside pySigma; rule
   problems raise `SigmaError` (a `ValueError` subclass). `yaml.YAMLError` is *not* a
   `SigmaError`. All three paths are caught.
3. **Dangling condition references are caught by nothing.**
   `condition: selection and nonexistent` parses cleanly and passes all 31 validators.
   Only forcing `rule.detection.parsed_condition[i].parse()` raises
   `SigmaConditionError: Detection 'nonexistent' not defined in detections`.

### Measured behavioural delta
Both validators were run over identical fixtures. 7 of the 11 characterization tests
changed behaviour:

| Fixture | Hand-rolled | pySigma | Direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| valid rule | clean | clean | unchanged |
| malformed YAML | error | error (`ParserError`) | unchanged |
| non-mapping document | error | error (`AttributeError`) | unchanged outcome |
| no `condition` | error | error (`SigmaConditionError`) | unchanged |
| no selections | error | error (`SigmaDetectionError`) | unchanged |
| missing `level` | **error** | accepted — `level` is optional in the Sigma spec | **old code was wrong** |
| `level: catastrophic` | warning | **error** (`SigmaLevelError`) | stricter |
| empty `logsource` | warning | **error** (`SigmaLogsourceError`) | stricter |
| non-`attack.*` tag | info | **warning** (`InvalidPatternTagIssue`, MEDIUM) | stricter |
| missing `id` (UUID) | not checked | warning (`IdentifierExistenceIssue`, MEDIUM) | new check |
| dangling condition ref | not caught | **error** | new check |

`REQUIRED_FIELDS` at the old `stage_review.py:17` listed `level`, but the Sigma
specification makes it optional — the system was rejecting valid rules. This was found
only by differential testing, not by reading the code.

### Changes
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `backend/pipeline/stage_review.py` | `_validate_syntax` → `_validate_rule`, reimplemented on pySigma; `REQUIRED_FIELDS` / `VALID_LEVELS` removed; `_SEVERITY_MAP` and `_render_issue` added |
| `tests/test_review_validation.py` | expectations updated to the measured delta; 2 tests added (dangling condition, missing UUID) |

Severity mapping: parse failure → `error`; `HIGH` → `error`; `MEDIUM` → `warning`;
`LOW` → `info`. Only `error` blocks a rule and triggers regeneration
(`orchestrator.py:185`). The issue-dict shape (`severity` / `field` / `message`) is
unchanged, so the orchestrator, SSE stream and frontend required no modification.

**`_validate_mitre_tactics` was deliberately retained.** pySigma's `ATTACKTagValidator`
only tests membership of a tag in a static allow-list; it does not check that a declared
tactic and technique are consistent with one another. The existing method does, using the
live ATT&CK graph from the RAG collection. The two are complementary, and the pySigma
list is a bundled snapshot whereas ours refreshes on re-ingestion.

### Known limitation accepted
`run()` validates rules one at a time, so each rule forms a single-rule collection. The
cross-rule validators (`DuplicateTitleIssue`, `IdentifierCollisionIssue`) can therefore
never fire. This is not a regression — no such check existed before — but validating the
batch as one collection would add it. Deferred.

### Verification
```
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q          → 13 passed in 0.11s
.venv/bin/python -c "import backend.main"     → imports cleanly
```
Both run with VPN disconnected and no API calls. Remaining pytest warnings are
pyparsing deprecations raised inside pySigma itself (upstream, not actionable here).

### Thesis relevance
- Supplies the E1/E2 oracle for the evaluation harness (Chapter 5): rules can now be
  scored by *violations per validator class* rather than a binary valid/invalid.
- The `level` defect is a concrete instance of the Chapter 6.4 argument — an error
  invisible to code review and to output inspection, surfaced only by differential
  measurement.
- Expect the regeneration rate to rise, since three former warnings are now fatal.
  This changes cost and latency per request and must be quantified once the harness
  exists; it is a candidate ablation arm.
